Statistical methods to study differential selection problems in cancer

# Introduction
[Introduction](Introduction.html)

# Model 
[Model](model.html)

# Simulations

[Power analysis based on simulations- only mutation count](simulation_power.html)

[Power analysis based on simulations- add one functional feature](simulation_power_FE.html)

[Power analysis based on simulations- add one functional feature-V2](simulation_power_FE2.html)

[Power analysis based on simulations- add one continuois phenotype with update baseline model](simulation_power_binary_conti.html)

# R package
We have developed an [R package](https://github.com/szhaolab/diffdriver) for our method. Currently it implements the approximated model for binary phenotype. We are extending it to quantitative phenotype.
